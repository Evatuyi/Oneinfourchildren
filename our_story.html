                                      <p>One in Four Children is Founded by Stephen Kamal, a child of war and former refugee. Stephen left the Nuba Mountains in 1996 after the intensely horrific war,
                                         drought and engineered famine that resulted in an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 deaths of the Nuba People.
                                      Stephen see’s education as a pillar of society. The Catalyst for One in Four Children were the many conversations
                                      with Nuba children in Refugee camps living in Uganda, Sudan, Egypt and Kenya, in which many students said lack of
                                      quality books was a major pain point for them. Along with Peter Sambia Kagi Kowa, they set out to change the
                                      narrative for so many of these children stuck in a complete cycle of poverty.
                                      We believe books change lives. We know because we’ve lived on both sides of the fence and the difference
                                      some literacy in the way of being able to read and write can make is immeasurable.</p>

                                      <h4><strong> The Nuba Mountains</strong></h4>
                                      <p>The People of the Nuba Mountains is a region in Sudan that continues to experience pervasive poverty, War trauma, lack basic health care services and poor nutrition.
                                        Education is the only way out. Every family has lived the experience of the war, many children are either orphaned
                                        or supported by single parents most of whom are mothers. Children especially young girls have been forced to remain at home to take
                                        care of their family, walking for days on end in search of water and food to eat the family, they are also tasked with general
                                        household duties which make it difficult to attain an education.

                                        For every girl educated, 7 more people benefit. The aim of One in Four is to promote equal opportunity and access to quality
                                        education for all children of the Nuba Mountains and Africa as a continent. We aim to build thriving, sustainable
                                         and self reliant communities wherever we work through Education initiatives that promote attainment of knowledge for all who seek.</p>

                                    have been killed in [aerial] attacks or summarily executed.” It is estimated that there are only 250–300 thousand Nuba left in SPLA-administered regions while at least 500 thousand have been forcibly resettled by the GoS in so-called “peace camps.” It is also estimated that, at a minimum, one hundred thousand, and possibly as many as two hundred thousand, Nuba have been forced from their villages and farms since 1983.</li></br>

                                  <li>September 27, 2011: More than 25,000 refugees flee to Ethiopia for refuge</li></br>
